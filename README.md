# Tendermint Consensus
Tendermint Consensus is a minimalistic implementation of the BFT consensus algorithm to securely replicate state machines ion multiple machines

First we will implement the original tendermint consensus algorithm in Rust. Then we will implement the modification done by [Starknet](https://community.starknet.io/t/tendermint-for-starknet/98248).
